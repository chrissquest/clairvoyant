# Cornflower

A magic themed mod based around a flower Minecraft includes, and so happened to be our randomly generated team name : Cornflower

Currently the mod offers only a few things, but this might be added onto post competition and more polished.

Cornflower essence, an item you get from breaking a clairvoyant enough, used to craft the clairvoyant wand Bottle essence, crafted with clairvoyant essence on top of a glass bottle.

The wand is a tool to initiate crafting, and instruct magical beings.

Craft with a gold nugget on the bottom, stick middle, and clairvoyant essence on top going diagonally

Right clicking on a vanilla cauldron with a clairvoyant will transform it into a clairvoyant cauldron, fire it up with a campfire underneath, right click in items and finish off with a click of the wand to craft a couple items in the mod.

Timeworn brick, a decorative brick made with brick and a clairvoyant essence in the cauldron. Slabs, stairs, and walls included.

Fey in a bottle, a little jar you can place down and release the creature inside with a click of the wand. Made with bottled essence, a clay ball, and a diamond.

Instruct the fey to transport items between chests by right clicking the input, and shift right clicking the output, then right click on the fey to transfer the instructions, and watch as they fly along, moving your items for you.
